# Estructura is a program which lets the user add numbers to a linked list and shows the median of the numbers. To run it you need 3 clases, the Estructura class which contains the main class, and the ListaEnlazada, which contains the linked list atributes and an exception to handle empty linked lists. It does not have Memory or CPU issues and it runs in a linear order. O(n).
